Carouth is a professional programmer specializing in web application
development; an author; an [amateur
photographer](http://flickr.com/photos/jcarouth); and an avid cyclist and
supporter of the Lance Armstrong Foundation. His programming background
started in 1999 when he was first introduced to developing websites using HTML
and JavaScript. After a year of self-study of C and C++ he took up a
programming class at his high school. He competed in the [UIL programming comp
etition](http://www.uil.utexas.edu/academics/computer_science/introduction.htm
l) in 2001. During the spring semester of 2004, Jeff enrolled in a course
taught by [Bjarne Stroustrup](http://parasol.tamu.edu/people/bs/) at Texas A&M
University and fell in love with C++ and programming all over again.

Simultaneous to course instruction Jeff was heavily involved in developing
dynamic web sites using PHP and MySQL. He took a job at[ Systek
Computing](http://www.systekct.com) in 2006 developing commercial
[websites](http://www.candy95.com) [for](http://www.marvet.org)
[local](http://www.paradisesnorkel.com) [businesses](http://www.ess-
group.com). Over the summer of 2007 he worked full time for
[SugarCRM](http://www.sugarcrm.com) in Cupertino, California and continued
working part-time as a telecommuting Software Engineer. In April 2008 Jeff and
SugarCRM parted ways and Jeff took a position at [Texas A&M
University](http://www.tamu.edu) in the [Division of Research and Graduate
Studies](http://rgs.tamu.edu) (RGS). September 2009 marked a shift from RGS to
the [Division of Marketing and Communications](http://www.tamu.edu/marcomm/)
(MarComm) for Jeff where he is now a Senior Software Applications Developer
working on projects such as the [Texas A&M University
homepage](http://www.tamu.edu).

Jeff is also a budding author. He published his first article with
[php|architect](http://phparch.com/) in the [November
2008](http://phparch.com/magazine/index/86) issue entitled,Â The Modern PHP
Workflow. The following year he published an article, Testable Code is
Successful Code, in the [December 2009](http://phparch.com/magazine/index/111)
issue of the same.

Outside of work Jeff is absolutely enamored with food. You will find him
watching the Food Network throughout the week picking up ideas and new
challenges in the kitchen. Specifically, he enjoys watching [Good
Eats!](http://www.foodnetwork.com/good-eats/index.html) with Alton Brown,
[Iron Chef America](http://www.foodnetwork.com/iron-chef-america/index.html),
[Dinner Impossible](http://www.foodnetwork.com/dinner-impossible/index.html)
with Robert Irvine, [Throwdown with Bobby Flay](http://www.foodnetwork.com
/throwdown-with-bobby-flay/index.html), and [Diners, Drive-ins and
Dives](http://www.foodnetwork.com/diners-drive-ins-and-dives/index.html) with
Guy Fieri. Jeff's future travel plans include visiting all three locations of
Bobby Flay's [Mesa Grill](http://www.mesagrill.com/).
