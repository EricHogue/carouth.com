Howdy! My name is Jeff Carouth. In many places available on the Internet I use the ever-so-creative nick [jcarouth](https://twitter.com/jcarouth). I am a web and mobile developer based in College Station, Texas, USA and I specialize in delivering applications developed with PHP, JavaScript, and friends. 

I am a member of TeamDev at [Liftopia, Inc.](http://www.liftopia.com) where you can find awesome deals on ski lift tickets and some related packages. My specific role at Liftopia is on the platform and architecture side. That means I am responsible for 

- advocating changes to the current codebase to improve developer experience and changeability
- introducing infrastructure and development practices for testing new code
- working with our VP of Engineering on workflow automation and deployment strategies and tools

This role is everything I've worked towards as a developer.

I frequently speak at conferences, user groups, and pretty much anywhere else people will hold a conversation with me. I am a co-organizer of the [Bryan/College Station PHP Users Group](http://bcsphp.org) and one of the organizers of the best HTML5 conference Texas has or will ever see, [HTML5.tx](http://html5tx.com). 

In addition to this blog I have contributed several articles to [php|architect](http://www.phparch.com/magazine) on testing, continuous integration, and mobile websites.

If you want to get in touch with me, I hold office hours on Twitter most of the day. Say hello [@jcarouth](https://twitter.com/jcarouth). Additionally I am routinely available in IRC on Freenode in #phpc and #phpmentoring.

Speaking of mentoring, I am a small part of the [PHP Mentoring](http://phpmentoring.org/) movement--I guess you could call it a movement. I am an apprentice with the comedian, testing slave driver, and all-around good guy [Chris Hartjes](https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer) working on my understanding and implementation of testing in PHP. I highly encourage you to check out the [PHP Mentoring site](http://phpmentoring.org/) and find a mentor to help you grow as a developer.
