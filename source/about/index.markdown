Jeff Carouth works on the Internet. He's been a very passionate web developer since 2003 and works tirelessly as a member of Team Dev at [Liftopia](http://www.liftopia.com).

When he's not working you'll likely find him at a community event. He owes a huge debt to the tech community surrounding technologies he uses on a daily basis, so he tries to give back as much as possible. He is a co-organizer of the [BCS PHP User Group](http://bcsphp.eventbrite.com/) in Bryan/College Station, Texas, a frequent participant in [WebGeekHappyHour](http://webgeekhappyhour.com), a conference speaker, and one of the team that brought [HTML5.tx](http://html5tx.com) to life in 2011.
